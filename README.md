# Airbnb Data Analysis

This project focuses on uncovering insights from the **Airbnb Open Data** by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. It was developed as a **minor project during my internship under the VOIS Group**.

The goal of this analysis is to explore how various factors ‚Äî such as property type, neighborhood, host information, and pricing ‚Äî influence Airbnb listings and customer experiences.

## üß† Objective

To analyze the Airbnb dataset and answer the following key questions:

1. What are the different property or room types in the dataset?
2. Which neighborhood or neighborhood group has the highest number of listings?
3. Which areas have the highest average prices for Airbnb listings?
4. Is there a relationship between the **construction year** of a property and its **price**?
5. Who are the **top 10 hosts** based on the calculated host listing count?
6. Are hosts with **verified identities** more likely to receive **positive reviews**?
7. Is there a **correlation between the listing price and service fee**?

## üìà Analysis Overview

The notebook performs the following analyses:

* Counts and visualizes the most common property/room types.
* Identifies neighborhoods with the highest number of listings.
* Computes and plots **average prices by area or neighborhood group**.
* Analyzes **price trends based on construction year**.
* Highlights the **top hosts** based on their listing counts.
* Performs a **statistical test** to check if verified hosts receive better ratings.
* Evaluates **correlation between service fee and listing price**.

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizations

The analysis includes:

* Bar charts for property types, neighborhoods, and top hosts
* Scatter plots and regression lines for price relationships
* Distribution plots for host verification and ratings
* Line plots showing average price/service fee trends

## üèÅ Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into Airbnb listings, helping understand:

* Which areas and property types dominate the platform
* How pricing varies with location and construction year
* The effect of host verification on customer reviews
* The relationship between listing price and service fee
